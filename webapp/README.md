## Isaiah needs this
for the page create.js I need a list of all the raffles the logged in owner has (I think its called Rafflesbyowner) and the images.
you can put them in a list or something it doesnt really matter im not sure what it will return but I can figure it out. For this page I also need the functions that would let the owner set the state of the raffle(pending,active ect..)

for the page join.js I need a list of all the raffles someone can join (the ones that are active)

for the page join_raffle.js i need function that lets a user join the raffle using the raffle they selected in the previous page and a way to get the price of the raffle they want to join to display it on that page.

as far as the errors go I think we could just put a message on screen when someone submits something that says if metamask approves transaction you good otherwise try again..

I would say as long as these calls shows up in a console.log i can make it happen on the front end.
im not sure what to do about when the winner is announced yet my brain hurts..



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
